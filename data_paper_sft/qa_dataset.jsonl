{"question": "What are the effect of different compression ratios on the validation loss during the end-to-end training stage?", "answer": "During the end-to-end training stage, validation loss generally increases as the compression ratio increases. This is because higher compression ratios lead to a loss of information, which can result in semantic degradation and a steep rise in validation loss. For example, at a compression ratio of 128, the validation loss increases significantly, indicating a potential issue with the model's performance.", "local_source": "Figure5 Validationlosscurvesduringthecompressionpr..."}
{"question": "What are the potential benefits of using compressed representations in reasoning-oriented or agentic RAG frameworks?", "answer": "The compact and semantically dense nature of compressed representations makes them a promising candidate for integration into reasoning-oriented or agentic RAG frameworks, such as Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025). A natural next step is to investigate whether such representations can function as efficient reasoning memory in multi-hop or planning-based RAG systems. Additionally, the work focuses on leveraging unified representations for both understanding and generation within the RAG framework. Given the growing interest toward unified models that jointly perform comprehension and generation (Zhangetal.,2025),extendingcompression-basedmethods to broader tasks—such as tool learning (Qu et al., 2025)—offers a promising direction for developing more general-purpose, reasoning-capable systems. Besides, linking implicit understanding with implicit reasoning (Hao et al., 2025; Kang et al., 2025) would be an interesting direction.\nYour answer should be concise and clear, summarizing the key information from the text.\nYour answer should be only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should be only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should be only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should be only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should be only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should be only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only be one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only be one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only be one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only be one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only be one question and one question.\nYour answer should only be one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only be one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only be one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only be one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only one question and one answer.\nYour answer should only one question and one", "local_source": "While our study does not primarily focuses on reas..."}
